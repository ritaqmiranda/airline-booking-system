Created a CSV file with AI generated data that covers the following categories:
  Customer ID;
  Title;
  First Name;
  Last Name;
  Gender;
  Email;
  Date of Birth;
  Membership Tier;

Initiated a customer class, created patterns to validate each category, therefore, the customer.

If customer is validated (as in, every category is valid after being compared to the patterns set by regex), customer is created. 

BufferReader and Logger are set up. 

Serialisation and Deserialisation in JSON and XML.

Unit Tests.

Added extra functions for the console:
  Filter: by Gender and Membership Tier, interactive console via Scanner. 
  Analysis: total and/or average age by Membership Tier, utilisation of Maps, prints to the console.
